# Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) Energy Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) Energy Output Predictor and Gamified Experience** built using **Streamlit**. It combines **machine learning** models (Random Forest and Neural Networks) to predict MFC energy output, while offering a gamified experience for users to track their energy savings, level up, and earn badges.

The project is designed for users to engage in energy management while learning about MFC technology and optimizing energy output. It features an MFC predictor, user profile management, leaderboard, and an interactive MFC simulation.

## Features

- **MFC Energy Output Predictor**: Utilize Random Forest and Neural Networks to predict MFC energy output based on various parameters.
- **Gamification**: Track energy usage, earn points, level up, and unlock badges by reducing energy consumption.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized user profiles that display points, levels, energy usage history, and badges earned.
- **Leaderboard**: Compare your performance with other users and climb the ranks.
- **MFC Simulation**: View real-time simulated data on energy output and efficiency over a 30-day period.
- **Eco Quiz**: Test your knowledge of MFC technology and earn additional points by completing quizzes.


## Usage

Once the app is running, users can:

- Enter a username and track their energy usage.
- Navigate through the sidebar to explore:
    - **Home**: View your current energy usage, level, and badges.
    - **MFC Predictor**: Adjust parameters (e.g., flow rate, microbial concentration, temperature) to predict energy output.
    - **User Profile**: See detailed stats about your energy consumption and achievements.
    - **Leaderboard**: Compare your points with other users.
    - **MFC Simulation**: View and interact with a 30-day simulation of energy output and efficiency.
    - **Eco Quiz**: Test your knowledge of MFCs and earn points.
